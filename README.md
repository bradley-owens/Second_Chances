# Second Chances

## Introduction

Second Chances is an application to help the user search throughout all the adoptables cats and dogs the PetFinder API has to offer and then maybe give someone a new bestfriend and a pet a second chance of a new home.

However, the PetFinder API only relays pets in the United States, unforutnate to the Australians out there.

## How it Works

Via the inputted search form, users can filter through the pets that the PetFinder API provides to the users specific wants and needs. Once rendered the pets will be shown through a card which the user can click to bring up a modal showing more information on the pet and link to where they can start the application.

## What is displayed

Throughout the application the user will recieve data such as:

    - An image of the pet
    - The name of the pet
    - The breed
    - Size of pet
    - Age of pet
    - Description tags
    - A modal that shows contact information, location and links to website for application.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used throughout this application is:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - ReactJS

This application was built using ReactJS and multiple hooks to maintain state throughout. Most state was passed through components through props as this application wasnt complex enough for the use of useContext or redux.
